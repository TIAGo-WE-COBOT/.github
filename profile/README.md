# TIAGo @ WE-COBOT organization
Collection of the ROS packages developed in the research activity with the [PAL Robotics TIAGo robot](https://pal-robotics.com/robots/tiago/) at the Wearable and Collaborative Robotics (WE-COBOT) lab at Politecnico di Milano - [Polo Territoriale di Lecco](https://www.polo-lecco.polimi.it/).

## Description
The organization is created to share resources with the researchers and students working with the TIAGo robot at the WE-COBOT lab. Although keeping an eye on general-purposeness, the code in this repo is meant to be TIAGo-specific and the packages are often interdependent.

Below you can find a list of journal and conference papers about the activity with the TIAGo robot.
